## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(jsonlite)

song_data <- fromJSON("https://stat.auckland.ac.nz/~fergusson/stats220_S124/data/lab4B.json")

nrow(song_data)

genre_data <- song_data %>%
  separate_rows(artist_genre, sep = ",") %>%
  group_by(artist_genre) %>%
  filter(n() >= 10)

## Including Plots
```
```{r}
summarised_data <- genre_data %>%
  group_by(artist_genre) %>%
  summarise(mean_danceability = mean(danceability))
  
summarised_data
```



```{r}
ggplot() + geom_point(data = summarised_data,
     aes(x = mean_danceability,
         y = reorder(artist_genre, mean_danceability)),
     shape = 17,
     colour = "red",
     size = 4) +
  geom_jitter(data = genre_data,
     aes(x = danceability,
         y = artist_genre),
     height = 0.3,
     colour = "pink",
     size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Comparing danceability of songs by genre",
     y = "Genre of song artist",
     x = "Danceability of song") +
  theme_minimal()

```
