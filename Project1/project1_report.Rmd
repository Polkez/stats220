## Project requirements

## Inspo meme
<img src ="inspo_meme.jpg" alt = "A picture of a person which is heaviliy edited to look compressed and red, with a photoshopped face of a youtuber named Markiplier with a letter E at the bottom" height = "300" width = "400">

The Key Components are:

* The noise in the image
* The heavily edited image as well
* The letter at the bottom of the image
* The photoshopped face on the the image of Mark Zuckerberg

## My meme
<img src ="my_meme.png" alt = "A picture of a Hbomberguy which is heavily edited to look compressed and red, with a letter H at the bottom of the image" height = "300" width = "400">

The differences are:

* The photoshopped face, might make the project a tad more complex so I did not do it.
* I did not edit it that much compared to the previous image, as it would make it more complex as well.

## My animated meme
<img src ="my_animated_gif.gif" alt = "A gif of a Hbomberguy which is heavily edited to look compressed and red, with a letter H at the bottom of the image" height = "300" width = "400">
