# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because I like programming, and this is a programming course about stats.
- I am interested in learning about how data is processed and managed, and also data scraping from the web.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is <br>
