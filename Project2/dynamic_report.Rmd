## Tracking my social media use and how I feel about using social media on my phone

Below are the summary values that exists within my survey to myself.

```{r}

# Average of ratings
print(paste0("The mean rating of social media usage is: ", 
             latest_data$social_media_feelings_rating %>% 
               mean() %>% round(1),
             " Out of 10"))

# min of ratings
print(paste0("The min rating of social media usage is: ", 
             latest_data$social_media_feelings_rating %>% 
               min() %>% round(1),
             " Out of 10"))

# max of ratings
print(paste0("The max rating of social media usage is: ", 
             latest_data$social_media_feelings_rating %>% 
               max() %>% round(1),
             " Out of 10"))

# number of responses
print(paste0("Number of responses: ", 
             latest_data %>% nrow()))

```

These summary values will show:

- Number of Responses is useful to check if the dynamic report is working as intended.

- the range of my responses, so it is useful to gauge the bad-est I felt (min) and also the good-est I felt (max)
(Also baddest does not mean good, it just means bad, in a bad way).

- The most useful value is the mean, since that should show how likely I am to rate highly (>5) or rate low (<=5), It will show the general sentiment I have about social media.


## Bar Graph 1 (How did I feel using social medias?) 

```{r}
# Creating the social media feeling ratings and showing the social media type
plot1 <- ggplot(data = latest_data) + 
    geom_bar(aes(fill = social_media_type, x = social_media_feelings_rating)) +
    labs(title = "My feeling ratings after opening the social media",
        subtitle = "Comparing my feeling ratings the type of social media",
        caption = "Source: Me : )",
        x = "Feelings Ratings (From 1 to 10)",
        y = "Number of responses")

# Printing the plot
print(plot1)

```

You can analyse how I feel about using social media general, or how I feel about using certain apps.
In this plot, it will show the distribution of the number of responses against how I felt, with the being the social media type.

## Bar Graph 2 (Did I use social media when I should be doing something else?)

```{r}
# Creating the yes and no plot and showing the social media type
plot2 <- ggplot(data = latest_data) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = social_media_type, x = should_you_be_using_right_now)) +
  labs(title = "Should you be using social media right now?",
       subtitle = "Comparing the yes and no results and the type of social media used",
       caption = "Source: Me : )",
       x = "Yes or No",
       y = "Number of responses")

# Printing the plot
print(plot2)
```

This part will analyse whether I like using social media in general.
The plot should show two categorical variables, yes and no, the answer to whether I should be using a social media right now.
